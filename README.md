# Sidewalk Labs & Numina
## Background
Sidewalk Labs aims to demonstrate that it is possible to carry out data collection on pedestrian activities in public space in a way that is consistent with the highest standards of privacy protection, and that the collected data can be analyzed to inform how best to improve the quality of life in public spaces.
In this project, we helped help Sidewalk Labs with the analysis of data collected by the Numina sensors deployed at "307". The 307, Lakeshore Blvd. E. location is Sidewalk Labs' hub, where they share with the public the tangible ideas it is exploring in partnership with numerous architecture, planning, and technology firms (https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/sidewalk-labs-307/). Several Numina sensors have been deployed and collecting data within and outside of the location for about a year.
## Project Objective
We built an interactive web page (see webpage.ipynb) to display and explain data allowing the Sidewalk Labs to answer the following questions.
1. How can we use the data to understand dwell time (i.e., where people spend a lot of time) at 307? Which areas of 307 do people pass through? Where do people tend to linger? How does dwell time change over time?
2. During events at 307 do people tend to dwell in certain spots or choose certain desire lines(i.e., where people come from and where they go)? Are dwell times or desire lines different compared to times when there are no events?
3. 307 requires maintenance after 500 visitors or 500 hours of use, when should 307 plan on scheduling maintenance operations (e.g., what days and times)?
4. Create a privacy philosophy for the web page and incorporate the philosophy into the web page. Numina claims that their sensors are able to provide "Intelligence without surveillance". Nevertheless, people, cars, etc. detected by these sensors are recorded without consent. Does this method of data collection balance individual privacy and benefits for society?

Note that there is a written user documentation explaining what data is being desplayed, and how to operate the webpage to answer the questions in the file "documentation.ipynb".
